# The un-official 'Escape From Tarkov' development roadmap
A simple website that contains known Tarkov development milestones for ease of use and clearer display of information for players. All information was publicly stated by a BSG developer at some point or comes directly from BSG's official channels.
Furthermore: All information is crowd-sourced, and as such, minor deviances from the correct information are expected, if that is the case, contact the developers with things to change.

> **:warning: This is not an official roadmap, every information displayed on the website is subject to change at the discretion of the developers at BattleState Games. This website is in no way, shape or form associated with BattleState Games in any official capacity.**

A live version of the website can be found at:
